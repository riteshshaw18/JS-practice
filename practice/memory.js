/*
memory has 2 types:
1.stack 2. heap


1.) stack: primitive data type are stored in stack.
here when we invoke the variable then we got copy not oriianl one ,
so all changes are done in copied one and not in original one .

2.) heap: nonprimitive data types are stored in heap.
here when we invoke the variable we got the reference ,so any changes made are done in original.
